Rideora is a modern ride-hailing app built with the MERN stack. It offers real-time tracking via Socket.io and Google Maps API, secure auth, dynamic fare calculation, and online payments. Designed for seamless user-driver interaction, Rideora delivers fast, scalable, and smooth urban travel.


1. Technology Stack (MERN)
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database storing user profiles, ride details, driver info, and location data. Ensures quick retrieval and scalability.

Express.js: Powers the backend RESTful APIs, handling ride requests, authentication, and data processing between React and Node.js.

React: Used for the responsive frontend, offering smooth UI/UX for passengers (booking rides, tracking drivers) and drivers (accepting rides, navigation).

Node.js: The server-side runtime that manages real-time operations (like tracking) and connects all MERN components efficiently.

2. Core Features

a) Real-Time Tracking (Socket.io + Google Maps API)
Live GPS Updates:

Drivers share their location in real-time via Socket.io, allowing passengers to track them on a map.

Passengers see ETAs, route changes, and traffic conditions via Google Maps API.

Geocoding: Converts addresses (e.g., "123 Main St") into map coordinates for precise pickups/drop-offs.

Notifications: Instant alerts for ride requests, driver arrivals, and trip completion.

b) Secure Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Securely verifies user/driver logins without exposing sensitive data.

Role-Based Access:

Passengers can book rides, view history, and rate drivers.

Drivers receive ride requests, manage trips, and track earnings.

Encryption: User passwords are hashed (bcrypt) to prevent breaches.

c) Dynamic Fare Calculation

Factors in pricing:

Distance (Google Maps calculates the shortest route).

Time (higher fares during rush hour).

Demand (surge pricing in busy areas).

Transparent pricing: Users see fare estimates before booking.

d) User-Driver Interaction

In-App Chat/Calls:

Messaging via Socket.io or voice calls (Twilio integration) for coordination.


3. Admin Dashboard
Analytics: Monitor ride volumes, revenue trends, and user growth.

Driver Management: Approve/reject drivers, resolve disputes, and track performance.

Support System: Handle user complaints and feedback.
